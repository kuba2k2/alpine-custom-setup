# alpine-custom-setup

This is a Buildroot external tree for installing Alpine Linux on some hardware that I own. There is also some info about getting the most of Alpine by configuring it properly.

Also see: [alpine-home-assistant](https://github.com/kuba2k2/alpine-home-assistant)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository somewhere, in this example `/work/acs`.
2. Install Buildroot. Then, execute the following command in Buildroot's directory:

```bash
make BR2_EXTERNAL=/work/acs <target>
```

The `<target>` can be one of:

- [`a10-bc1077`](board/a10-bc1077/README.md) - BC1077 (MID06N/Inet1/Protab2XXL)
- [`exynos4412-i9300`](board/exynos4412-i9300/README.md) - Samsung Galaxy S3 (GT-I9300)
- [`h3-banana-pi-m2-plus`](board/h3-banana-pi-m2-plus/README.md) - Banana Pi M2+
- [`h3-fingbox-v1`](board/h3-fingbox-v1/README.md) - Fingbox v1
- [`rk2926-tac-70072`](board/rk2926-tac-70072/README.md) - Denver TAC-70072 Rockchip RK2926 Tablet

3. Run `make all` to compile all packages. Also, make sure to run `make clean` before configuring a different target.
4. Go to the chosen board's README file to follow the installation guide.

## Configure - post-install

See [`docs/alpine.md`](docs/alpine.md) for various tips for best usability.
